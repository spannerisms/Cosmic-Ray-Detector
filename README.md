# Cosmic Ray Detector
This program is a special-made ROM to detect radiation from the environment. Simply run this on a Super Nintendo Entertainment System and wait. The screen will begin as a black slate, but as alpha particles, beta particles, and the occasional gremlin interact with WRAM to flip bits, white dots will appear on the screen.
